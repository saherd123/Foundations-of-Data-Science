    "First, let's extract the date and time from the `released_at` column in `msft_news_df`. Notice that the date and time are encoded in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<date>May 29 2012</date> <time>09:40:58</time>\n",
    "<date>May 18 2011</date> <time>22:42:40</time>\n",
    "<date>August 15 2012</date> <time>00:09:02</time>\n",
    "<date>July 1 2011</date> <time>22:12:37</time>\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to convert this to a `Timestamp` object that we can use more easily. However, for this assignment, we are going to use string manipulation functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Create a regular expression that extracts the Month, Day, Year, Hour, Minute, and Second from the `msft_news_df[\"released_at\"]` column. You should create a new `DataFrame` called `dates` that contains:\n",
    "1. The same index as `msft_news_df` (`id`) and\n",
    "2. Column labels: `\"Month\"`, `\"Day\"`, `\"Year\"`, `\"Hour\"`, `\"Minute\"`, `\"Second\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, convert all numerical values (`\"Year\"`, `\"Day\"`, `\"Hour\"`, `\"Minute\"`, `\"Second\"`) to type `int`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 1:** You should use the [`Series.str.extract`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.extract.html) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 2:** Don't forget to use raw strings and capture groups. Copy the above example text into [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) to experiment with your regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint 3:** It might be helpful to break this up into a couple of steps (e.g., first extract date values such as Month, Day, and Year and then extract time values such as Hour, Minute, and Second)."

    "The trend I notice is that Apple's performance is signifcantly higher than the rest of the companies listed. Apple's trend is also steely upwards until 2012 and then declines. 2012 is also the year the Amazon and Facebook begin to decline. Whereas, 2012 is the year that Ninetendo and Sony go up and Netfix stays stagnant. The limitations of this data is that these companies are only being referenced given that microsoft is being referenced. So, a company like Netflix that has no active association with Microsoft as a company or in their target audience will not be mentioned as often as Apple, Microsoft's largest opponent company, would be mentioned."

DistilBERT is a neural network-based language model (a close relative to ChatGPT); we will use the model checkpoint specifically trained for sentiment analysis. These models are not in scope for Data 100, and we don't expect you to know how they work; take CS182: Neural Networks or Data 102: Data, Inference, and Decisions if you're interested in learning more. We are using them here to show how easy (and useful) these technologies have become.\n",

The content score must then be later lowered with the mentioning of other things not directly related to the country.
